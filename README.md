### Project goal : 

__Analysis of the quality of governance of European regions__. 

The project's goal is to analyze and explain, using an econometric model, the disparities in governance quality within and between European countries. For this, we use databases from Eurostat and the University of Gothenburg, including:
- https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/database
